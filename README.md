I failed to get it to work in wither PyCharm and it also does not work independentl
However it does run in Anaconda Promt
Steps 
1 - python -m venv myenv
2 - myenv\Scripts\activate
3 - pip install numpy
4 - pip install pyttsx3
5 - pip install textblob
6 - pip install pyaudio
7 - python location of file\\Idontknowhwatimdoing.py

this should work hopefully
